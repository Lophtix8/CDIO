# Project Plan

## Introduction 
This program means to preform a material dynamic simulation on an array of materials with a selected number of degrees of freedom. The data extracted from the simulation will then be analyzed and plotted.
The main simulation will consist of forces applied to a bulk material to simulate a stress on the material casing it to fracture.

## Roadmap
The project will be divided in to tree (possibly overlapping) phases. The "Build and setup phase", the "Material simulation phase" and the "Data analysis and plotting phase". These are also depicted in the program schematic.

### Milestones
- Simulating a tear in a bulk material
- Finishing the finale report
